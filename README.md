# Amazon-FrontEnd-Clone
Designed the front-end interface replicating Amazon's website, focusing on creating a visually appealing structure using HTML and enhancing it with CSS for styling. This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in web development, ensuring that the design was both functional and aligned with modern UI/UX standards.
